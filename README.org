* NWS

** NWS is an online news reader

   NWS is a php CMS to manage various XML (RSS, aTom, etc) news feeds
   and present them in a nice, ergonomic fashion. I made it to replace the online
   news services that I use up until around 2007, when they became bloated and
   crippled with spyware. It's really a [[https://github.com/xaccrocheur/nws/blob/master/screenshot.png][barebones]] system, but I've
   been using it for +weeks+ years now, and it basically does what I want.

*** Features
   - AJAX (asynchronous) loading of the feeds (ie reload one single feed w/o reloading the whole page)
   - Handles any charset encoding/langage
   - Grabs the most out of the description text and displays it as standard tooltip on mouse hover
   - Does its best to parse any given feed and identify it w/o questions
   - Plays nice with different resolutions & ergonomics, ie phones, tablets, etc
   - Directly links to any included image (and sound file)
   - If any, displays item image, wrapped around text (displays it full width if it's the only item's element, or if it comes from a photoblog - set those up [[https://github.com/xaccrocheur/nws/blob/master/nws-load-feed.php][here]])
   - Totally self-contained. No linked librairies, online commodities or, heaven forbid, "statistics" trackers
   - Lightweight and standard (valid HTML5 code)

*** Installation
   - Copy the files in a directory within a webserver root.
   - Point your browser to that webserver's directory. That's it.
   - Oh, if you want to use the caching features (faster and more private) make sure that the web server has the right to write to said directory:
     - On the average web server (Debian / Apache) it's generally just a matter of, in the root folder: 'sudo chown .www-data .'
   - or create it yourself : cache and cache/favicon (NWS works perfectly w/o caching, only a little less fast)
   - Recommended : Protect (restrict access to) the back-office
     - Use [[https://duckduckgo.com/?q%3Dhtpassword%2Bgenerator][a trusted online htpassword generator]] (You can also create user/password pair(s) directly on the server with the command "htpasswd -b .access username password")
     - Paste this user/password pair in a file, and upload it as nws/.access (or another - secure - location, see below)
     - Optional : Move the .access out of the http server root, and edit .htaccess to reflect this change.

*** Usage
   - Navigate the tabs with < left and > right arrow keys (and r & t)
   - Click the big "►" to view all tabs's images in a gallery
   - Click the small, item's "►" to view all feed's images in a gallery
     - Navigate the gallery's images with < left and > right arrow keys
     - Exit the gallery by clicking outside it, or pressing the ESC key
   - Use the "Manage feeds" link to access the "back office"
     - Use the "add a new feed" text entry field at the bottom to enter a new feed
     - Use the "new tab" text entry field to create a new category
     - Use the "change this feed's tab" menu to re-categorize the feed
     - Use the "promote this feed" (^) link to bump up a feed as 1st of its tab
     - Use the "delete this feed" (x) link to delete a feed
   - Or directly edit [[https://github.com/xaccrocheur/nws/blob/master/feeds.xml][feeds.xml]] (way faster).
   - Use "Pin tab" in your browser to prevent tab clutter
   - Use [[http://www.firefoxfacts.com/2013/08/14/back-is-close/][Back is close]] to quickly go back to where you were
