{"name":"Nws","tagline":"A personal track-free online RSS news reader","body":"# NWS\r\n\r\n## NWS is an online news reader\r\n![NWS screenshot](https://raw.github.com/xaccrocheur/nws/master/screenshot.png)\r\n   NWS is a php CMS to manage various XML (RSS, aTom, etc) news feeds\r\n   and present them in a nice, ergonomic fashion. I made it to replace the online\r\n   news services that I use up until around 2007, when they became bloated and\r\n   crippled with spyware. It's really a [[https://github.com/xaccrocheur/nws/blob/master/screenshot.png][barebones]] system, but I've\r\n   been using it for +weeks+ years now, and it basically does what I want.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n   - AJAX (asynchronous) loading of the feeds (ie reload one single feed w/o reloading the whole page)\r\n   - Handles any charset encoding/langage\r\n   - Grabs the most out of the description text and displays it as standard tooltip on mouse hover\r\n   - Does its best to parse any given feed and identify it w/o questions\r\n   - Plays nice with different resolutions & ergonomics, ie phones, tablets, etc\r\n   - Directly links to any included image (and sound file)\r\n   - If any, displays item image, wrapped around text (displays it full width if it's the only item's element, or if it comes from a photoblog - set those up [[https://github.com/xaccrocheur/nws/blob/master/nws-load-feed.php][here]])\r\n   - Totally self-contained. No linked librairies, online commodities or, heaven forbid, \"statistics\" trackers\r\n   - Lightweight and standard (valid HTML5 code)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n   - Copy the files in a directory within a webserver root.\r\n   - Point your browser to that webserver's directory. That's it.\r\n   - Recommended : Protect (restrict access to) the back-office\r\n     - Use [[https://duckduckgo.com/?q%3Dhtpassword%2Bgenerator][a trusted online htpassword generator]] (You can also create user/password pair(s) directly on the server with the command \"htpasswd -b .access username password\")\r\n     - Paste this user/password pair in a file, and upload it as nws/.access (or another - secure - location, see below)\r\n     - Optional : Move the .access out of the http server root, and edit .htaccess to reflect this change.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n   - Navigate the tabs with < left and > right arrow keys (and r & t)\r\n   - Use the \"Manage feeds\" link to access the \"back office\"\r\n     - Use the \"add a new feed\" text entry field at the bottom to enter a new feed\r\n     - Use the \"new tab\" text entry field to create a new category\r\n     - Use the \"change this feed's tab\" menu to re-categorize the feed\r\n     - Use the \"promote this feed\" (^) link to bump up a feed as 1st of its tab\r\n     - Use the \"delete this feed\" (x) link to delete a feed\r\n   - Or directly edit [[https://github.com/xaccrocheur/nws/blob/master/feeds.xml][feeds.xml]] (way faster).\r\n   - Use \"Pin tab\" in your browser to prevent tab clutter\r\n   - Use [[http://www.firefoxfacts.com/2013/08/14/back-is-close/][Back is close]] to quickly go back to where you were\r\n\r\n### LICENSE\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
